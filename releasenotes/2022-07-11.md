Features:
- Audio media access enables application developers to access the incoming call audio stream and send custom outgoing audio stream during the call. 
	* Incoming audio stream, can be accessed right on the call object.
	* Outgoing audio stream, application can create custom [`mediaStreamTrack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) and set it as outgoing source stream when in a call.
- Mute incoming audio feature will help to mute / unmute the incoming audio. So that, the speaker will not playback the incoming call audio directly.
