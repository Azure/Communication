## UI Library

### Xamarin & React Native Samples
We are pleased to share an exciting release to bring solutions to help the developers to build Cross Platform solutions using the UI Library. The UI Library team created a couple of guides integrating the UI Library with Xamarin and React Native. Both guidelights have the capabilities to exploit the Calling composite capabilities and enjoy the same experience, such as the Native UI Library.
