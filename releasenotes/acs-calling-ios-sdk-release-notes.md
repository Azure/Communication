# ACS Calling iOS (Objective-C) SDK - Release History

## v2.0.0 (2021-12-13)
[Azure Communication Calling iOS SDK v2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

## v1.0.0 (2021-04-27)
Azure Communication Calling iOS SDK version `1.0.0`.

**This is the first General Availability (GA) release.**

### Breaking changes
1. Video removed/added event are not raised when application stops rendering an incoming video.
2. Teams interop and all other preview APIs are no longer available in the mainstream SDK drop. Please use libraries marked with the -beta suffix for these features.

## v1.0.0-beta.12 (2021-04-13)

### New features
- `DeviceManager` instance can be obtained irrespective of `CallAgent` creation.

### Breaking changes
- Added `Nullability` annotations for parameters in delegate methods, properties and return types in init. This removes for e.g. the need for the application to force un-wrap objects created by the SDK where applicable.
- Delegate method signatures renamed to confirm with Swift guidelines. Similar to [UIApplicationDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate).
- Block `CallAgent` creation with same user.
- `IsMuted` event is added to the `Call` class. Event will be triggered when the call is locally or remotely muted.
- Multiple classes properties/methods renamed:
   - `Call` class:
       - Property `callDirection` renamed to `direction`.
       - Property `isMicrophoneMuted` renamed to `isMuted`.

    - `VideoOptions` class:
       - `LocalVideoStream` property is now `LocalVideoStreams` making it an array.
       - The constructor for `VideoOptions` now takes an array of `LocalVideoStream` as parameter.

- `RenderingOptions` has been renamed `CreateViewOptions`.

- `startCall` and `join` API's on `CallAgent` are now asynchronous.

- Mandatory to pass completion handler block for all async API's.

### Bug fixes
- SDK Crash when another guest user joins a Teams meeting with Video on. https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/218

### New features

- Improved caching of objects. 
- Added new call state `Hold` when a remote participant puts the call on hold.

### Breaking changes

- `AudioDeviceInfo` removed from `DeviceManager`, please use iOS system API's in your application to switch between audio devices.
- `CallAgent` raises a new event `onIncomingCall` when a new incoming call is received. 
- `IncomingCall` raises a new event `onCallEnded` event is raised when the incoming call wasn't answered.
- `Accept` and `Reject` can now be done on `IncomingCall` object and removed from `Call` object.
- For parsing of push notification payload `IncomingCallPushNotification` has been renamed to `PushNotificationInfo`.
- `CallerInfo` class created which provides information about the caller in an incoming call. Can be retrieved from `IncomingCall` and `Call` objects. 

### Bug fixes
- `OnCallsUpdated` event is raised when the call collection on `CallAgent` is updated for outgoing calls.
- `Hold` and `Resume` of an active call is fixed. 

## v1.0.0-beta.8 (2021-02-08)

- Parameter labels are mandatory for all API calls from Swift Applications.
- Except the first argument all other arguments in delegates will need parameter labels in Swift Applications.
- Exception is thrown if an application tries to render video/camera twice.

- `Info.plist` has version following semantic version schema for `CFBundleVersion` and `CFBundleShortVersionString` entries (https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/113).

- Call.hangup() now terminates call if the call is in Connecting or Ringing state ([GitHub Issue 96](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/96))
- Calling SDK was raising RemoteVideoStream removed event when app stopped rendering it. SDK now raises a follow-up RemoteVideoStream added event once the stream is ready to be rendered again. ([GitHub Issue 95](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/95))

### Onboarding
The SDK is released for the following platforms: arm64 and x86_64 (simulator)
<br/>Minimum supported iOS SDK version is 12.0
<br/>**BuildAzurePackages.sh script works only with Xcode 11.5 and above**
<br/>Please refer to the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling?pivots=platform-ios) of how to bootstrap a Calling sample application on iOS.

### Limitations
* While the ability to make PSTN calls is available in the SDK, you need a PSTN number in ACS to make the call. PSTN functionality is available under private preview; follow this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/get-phone-number) for availability updates
* The PSTN and VOIP access token scopes are currently not enforced. All-access tokens implicitly authorize users to access VOIP and PSTN calling functionality until further notice.
