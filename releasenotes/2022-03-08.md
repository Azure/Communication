### Java
#### [1.1.0 (2022-02-23)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/communication/azure-communication-common/CHANGELOG.md#110-2022-02-23)

##### Features
- Added new constructor with required param `tokenRefresher` for `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions`
- Deprecated old constructor overloads in `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions` and replaced by fluent setters
- Added fluent setters for optional properties:
    - Added `setRefreshProactively(boolean refreshProactively)` setter that allows setting whether the token should be proactively renewed prior to its expiry or on demand.
    - Added `setInitialToken(String initialToken)` setter that allows setting the optional serialized JWT token
- Added a synchronous token refresher getter `getTokenRefresherSync` for `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions`
- Optimization added: When the proactive refreshing is enabled and the token refresher fails to provide a token that's not about to expire soon, the subsequent refresh attempts will be scheduled for when the token reaches half of its remaining lifetime until a token with long enough validity (>10 minutes) is obtained.

##### Breaking Changes
- Migrated from using `@azure/core-http` to `@azure/core-rest-pipeline` for the handling of HTTP requests. See [Azure Core v1 vs v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/core/core-rest-pipeline/documentation/core2.md) for more on the difference and benefits of the move.
  - `createCommunicationAccessKeyCredentialPolicy` and `createCommunicationAuthPolicy` newly return `PipelinePolicy` instead of `RequestPolicyFactory`.
