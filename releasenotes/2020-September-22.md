### Onboarding
The SDK is packaged as FAT SDK artifact with all ABIs (arm64-v8a, x86_64) supported on the Android platform.
<br/>Please refer to the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling) of how to bootstrap a Calling sample application on android.

### Limitations
* While the ability to make PSTN calls is available in the SDK, you need a PSTN number in ACS to make the call. PSTN functionality is available under private preview; follow this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony-sms/get-phone-number) for availability updates
* The PSTN and VOIP access token scopes are currently not enforced. All-access tokens implicitly authorize users to access VOIP and PSTN calling functionality until further notice.  
*  We don't support x86 simulators, arm7 support is coming soon
