# Roadmap and current private preview features

This feature list is a peek into our roadmap, and clones [our GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/projects/1). We recommend viewing the GitHub project but this flattened list is provided as a usability aide. 

It identifies some of the significant features we are currently working on and a rough timeframe for when you can expect to see them. It is not comprehensive but is intended to provide some visibility into key investments.

These features and dates are the current plans at this time and are subject to change. The **Area** column reflects the area of the product the feature aligns with most, and **State**  indicates if the feature will be in public preview or generally available.  Links are provided to Azure DevOps (ADO) tracking that is used internally by Microsoft.

### General Availability
In early 2021, the core service should exit preview and be generally available. This corresponds to several product updates:

- APIs and client libraries will be marked stable
- SLA guarantees and documentation
- Availability in additional Azure geographies such as Europe
