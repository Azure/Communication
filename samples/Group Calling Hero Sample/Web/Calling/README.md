# Group Calling Sample

This is a sample application to show how the ACS Calling Web SDK can be used to build a group calling experience. 
The client-side application is a React based user interface which uses Redux for handling complex state while leveraging Microsoft Fluent UI. 
Powering this front-end is a C# web application powered by ASP.net Core to connect this application with Azure Communication Services.

Additional documentation for this sample can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/samples/calling-hero-sample).

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- [Node.js (12.18.4 and above)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Visual Studio (2019 and above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You'll need to record your resource **connection string** for this quickstart.

## Code structure

- ./Calling/ClientApp: frontend client
	- ./Calling/ClientApp/src
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Components : React components to help build the client app calling experience
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Containers : Connects the redux functionality to the React components
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Core : Containers a redux wrapper around the ACS Web Calling SDK
	- ./ClientApp/src/index.js : Entry point for the client app
- ./Calling/Controllers : Server app core logic for client app to get a token to use with the ACS Web Calling SDK
- ./Calling/Program.cs : Entry point for the server app program logic
- ./Calling/Startup.cs : Entry point for the server app startup logic

## Before running the sample for the first time
1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Azure/Communication.git`
3. Get the `Connection String` from the Azure portal. For more information on connection strings, see [Create an Azure Communication Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource)
4. Once you get the `Connection String`, add the connection string to the **Calling/appsetting.json** file found under the Calling folder. Input your connection string in the variable: `ResourceConnectionString`. 

## Locally deploying the sample app

1. Go to Calling folder and open `Calling.csproj` solution in Visual Studio
2. Run `Calling` project. The browser will open at localhost:5001

### Troubleshooting

1. Solution doesn\'t build, it throws errors during NPM installation/build
	
	Clean/rebuild the C# solution

## Publish to Azure

1. Right click the `Calling` project and select Publish.
2. Create a new publish profile and select your app name, Azure subscription, resource group and etc.
3. Before publish, add your connection string with `Edit App Service Settings`, and fill in `ResourceConnectionString` as key and connection string (copy from appsettings.json) as value
